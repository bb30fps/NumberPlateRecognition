# Number Plate Recognition System ðŸš—ðŸ“„

A deep learning-based system to detect and recognize license plates from images using PyTorch. Trained on custom datasets with XML annotations.

# Features
- **Object Detection**: Localize license plates in images using bounding boxes.
- **Text Recognition**: Extract text from detected plates using a CNN + LSTM model.
- **Custom Dataset Support**: Works with XML and JPG annotations.
- **Google Colab Integration**: Train your model on GPU for faster results.
